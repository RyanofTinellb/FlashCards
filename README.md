# FlashCards
## An Android app for the learning of vocabulary

This program is written in Java, using Android Studio.

Currently, there are small wordlists in Arabic (العَرَبِيَّة), Basque (Euskara), Japanese (日本語), as well as for two constructed languages, Toki Pona (created by Sonja Lang) and Lulani (created by me). There are also facilities to practice the Japanese kyōiku kanji (教育漢字) and the uniliteral Egyptian hieroglyphs.

The main program files are in /app/src/main/java/ryan/flashcards/

Expansion possibilities include more languages and/or more vocabulary items.

TODO: Vocabularies are currently hard-coded. It would be better to have these as separate text files.
